# SSH configuration snippet to enable SSH tunneling to github.com via
# port 443. Turns off all unnecessary SSH protocols extensions that slow
# things down or break things. In order to prevent SSH key leakage (which
# isn't dangerous, since it's just your public key, but it's still better
# if it didn't leave the network), this configuration will only use the
# SSH key specified on the "Identity" line.
#
# Note: make sure you understand how SSH parses config files. It does it
# in a really awful way (in my opinion) and can really screw you up if you
# aren't aware of it. It applies the *last* option found after it parses
# through all host entries (~/.ssh/config and then /etc/ssh/ssh_config).
# Host-specific declarations should be given near the beginning of the
# file, and general defaults at the end. Watch for wildcards. They bite.
#
# Works with OpenSSH 6.6+
